A design pattern is not exclusive to any programming language; it is simply a guideline or template, whereas a Java library is pre-written code that can be accessed directly.

public class DBSSingelton{
  private static DBSSingelton file;
  private static Connection connection;
  private DBSSingelton(){
    connection = new Connection("username, "12345", "120.5.4.4");
  }

  public static DBSSingelton getInstance(){
    if(connection == null){
      connection = new DBSSingelton();
    }

    return file;
    
  }
}

public class AnimalFactory {

  public static Animal getAnimal(String option, String name, int weight){
      switch(option){
          case "mammal":
              return new Mammal(name, weight);
          case "bird":
              return new FacultyAccount(name, weight);
        
      }
    return null;
  }
}

public class Aquarium {
	public void feedAll(ArrayList<Fish> tanks, int numFishInTank) {...}
	public void cleanAll(ArrayList<Fish> tanks)
}

This code works well with the following Fish class:

public class Fish{
	public void feed(String food, int weight) {...}
	public void clean(String cleaningProduct) {...}
}
We may also one day inherit an animal hospital in which each patient is alone in a cage. We'd like to utilise the code above to feed and clean all of the animals' cages, but our hospital has the following API for the mammals they serve:

public class Mammal{
	public void feed(String food, int weight, String medication) {...}
	public void clean() {...}
}

# Use the Adapter pattern to allow us to use the Mammal class with the Aquarium class above. Each animal is housed alone in its cage during its visit. All mammals are given the same medication, namely, "antibiotics".

    public class MamalAdapeter extends Fish {
    private Mammal mammal;
    public static void feed (String food, int weight) {
    return mammal.feed(food, weight, "antibiotics");
    }
    public static void clean (String CleaningProduct) {
    return json.getExperiements().toArrat;
    }
    }

The bridge architecture separates what a system does from how it is done and allows for good OOP concepts, as well as easier maintenance.
